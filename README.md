Passenger Re-Identification using GAN
Abstract

Passenger re-identification (Re-ID) is a critical component in intelligent transportation systems, particularly for public bus monitoring and analytics. This research focuses on developing a GAN-based passenger re-identification system capable of identifying the same passenger across multiple camera views and time instances within a bus environment. The proposed approach addresses challenges such as occlusion, illumination changes, low-resolution CCTV footage, and appearance variations.

The system is designed as part of a Smart Bus Research Project, contributing to improved passenger analytics, fraud prevention, and transport system transparency.

Research Objectives

Develop a robust passenger re-identification model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Improve feature invariance across camera views and lighting conditions

Enable scalable deployment for real-world bus environments

Support downstream analytics such as passenger flow estimation and behavior analysis
